# attract-and-repel

go here to see a cool visualization made from this sketch
https://vimeo.com/215435761

first you'll need processing:
https://processing.org/download/

warning - by default this sketch set up to capture a video, for which you'll need ffmpeg (i installed on mac osx with)
brew install ffmpeg

you'll also need to install the Video Export library (look under sketch menu, import library, add library...)

to export a video, set the EXPORT constant to true and it will create a pretty big video file in your sketch directory

play around with the parameters, modify it and do a pull request :)

enjoy!
